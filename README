jmake script options:

Usage: ./jmake [mode] [optional-args]


compile
	This will compile the source code and create the executable jar file
	Jsi3/bin/jsi3.jar

	Files in Jsi3/resource will be included in the jar
	Files in Jsi3/copyrights will be included in the jar

	Any dependencies must be in the CLASSPATH, or in the
	Jsi3/lib/dependencies.txt file.
	These dependencies must be found dynamically at compile time.

	[optional-args] are passed to the javac process


doc
	run javadoc over src code and place generated html into Jsi3/javadoc

	[optional-args] are passed to the javadoc process


clean
	removes Jsi3/javadoc/* [generated documentation]
	removes Jsi3/lib/class/* [compiled class files]
	removes Jsi3/bin/jsi3.jar [executable jar file]

	[optional-args] are ignored


**) the compiling stage tries to tag the source code - if you don't have the
jtag executable it may complain, but it will still build the code, but the
BUILD variable in the jsi3.LibJsi3 class won't be incremented and the
BUILD_TIME variable in the jsi3.LibJsi3 class won't be updatd.
